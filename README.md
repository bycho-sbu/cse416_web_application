# problem statement

Problem: Many students today struggle with crafting effective resumes due to insufficient support and guidance. This often leads to apprehension and embarrassment when they must present their resumes, which can hinder their career opportunities and self-confidence.


Solution: To address this problem, we propose the development of a web application that leverages AI to offer resume evaluations. This app will provide students with a private and supportive environment to practice and refine their resume quality. By offering constructive feedback on resumes with AI, the app aims to boost students' confidence and competence in their job search efforts.
