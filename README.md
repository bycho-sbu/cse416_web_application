# problem statement

Problem: 
Many students today struggle with crafting effective resumes and preparing for job interviews due to insufficient support and guidance. 
This often leads to apprehension and embarrassment when they must present their resumes or participate in interviews,
which can hinder their career opportunities and self-confidence. 

Solution:
To address this problem, we propose the development of a web application that leverages AI to offer
mock interviews and resume evaluations. This app will provide students with a private and supportive environment
to practice and refine their interview skills and resume quality. By simulating real-world interview scenarios and 
offering constructive feedback on resumes with AI, the app aims to boost students' confidence and competence in their 
job search efforts.
